# Gaia - AI Toolkit
## gaia-test.prompt.md (this prompt) Instructions
### Introduction
The following repo was generated by an advanced prompting system for generating full-stack end to end solutions. From simple to complex. We call this system/framework the Gaia AI Toolkit.

What your job is now is to test the entire stack that was generated. This means you must spin up the entire stack and test each flow in the UI. If you encounter any errors, you must fix them and resume testing the next flow. You must do this until all flows are tested and working. Including all navigation.

### What to Do
- Follow instructions in [gaia-plan.prompt.md](.gaia/prompts/gaia-plan.prompt.md) with the following goal in mind.
    - Spin up the entire stack for us and test each flow before my eyes by using your playwright tools.
    - On any errors, you must resolve then resume the next flow UI regression test (yourself, using your playwright mcp tools).
    - When you encounter an error, you must fix it, retest iterate and resume the next flow test.
        - This means fixing all frontend issues.
            - When encountering issues that you believe are valid, like error scenarios, then there must be a clear indicator to the user as to why something failed.
        - This means fixing all backend issues.
        - This means fixing all database issues.
        - This means fixing all API integration issues.
    - You must test the stack via Docker strictly.
        - If docker isnt installed, install it.
        - If docker isn't in the path, add it permanently and resume.
        - When running docker commands, dont run commands that keep the terminal busy. Use -d or --detach flags for example and when looking through logs etc, ensure that we use --tail 100 or similar to avoid overwhelming the terminal.
    - You must test the stack via playwright strictly.
    - You must ensure proper full-stack integration.
        - All data must come from the API.
        - No mock data should be used.
        - No data placeholders may be used. Real-data only.
    - If there are any live connectivity functions for example ones that required web sockets, you must test concurrent connections, navigation, data submissions, propagations etc. You will need 2 or more browser windows for this.
    - After resolving the issues, ensure you update the regression pack to work with the new, fixed solution.

### What **Not to Do**
- **Don't** ever skip tests or proceed just because one project in the stack works. All projects must be working and tested before you can declare the entire stack is working.
- Dont run Playwright tests via scripts. You MUST use your Playwright MCP tools to run the tests so i can follow along as you go. You MUST use screenshots and console logs at every turn to ensure functionality.
- Dont assume ANY errors are edpected. All errors must be resolved, all missing functionality should be implemented and the stack must be fully functional.
- Dont just resolve "core" issues. You must comprehensively resolve all issues.
